# Cimple

Cimple is a performance-oriented programming language designed with Python-like syntax and systems-level capability in mind.

This repository contains the early-stage compiler frontend built using a handwritten recursive-descent parser.

## Current Status

Cimple v0.0.1 supports:

- Function definitions
- If / Elif / Else
- While loops
- Assignments
- Return statements
- Arithmetic, boolean, bitwise expressions
- Comparisons
- Function calls
- String and numeric literals

This is a syntax-focused milestone.  
Semantic analysis, type checking, and code generation are under active development.

## Design Goals

- Clean Python-style syntax
- Predictable performance
- LLVM-based backend
- Low-level control without syntactic noise
- Minimal core language, extensible by design

## Roadmap

The next major focus areas:

- Type system implementation
- Semantic analyzer
- LLVM IR generation
- GPU programming extensions
- Toolchain stabilization

Cimple is currently experimental and subject to breaking changes.

Building a language is a long-term systems engineering effort.  
cimplev0.0.1 is the foundation.
